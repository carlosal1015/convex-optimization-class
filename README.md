# Advanced Convex Optimization class
APPM 5630 at CU Boulder
Prof. Becker, Spring 2021. Meeting time: MWF 10:20 -- 11:10 AM, ECCR 1B40.  COVID-19 details: this class is currently scheduled to meet **in person**.

This repo contains in-class demos and some homework solutions (much of it is from Fall 2018 when this class was taught as a special topics course 4720/5720)

The [2018 syllabus](APPM4720_5720_Fall2018_Syllabus.pdf) is available here on github, and the 2021 syllabus will be posted in December or January.

Here is a list of [2018 class project topics](SlideshowAllPresentations_4720Fall18.pdf) in a nice PDF, as well as [2017 class projects](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/SlideshowAllPresentations_4720Spr17.pdf)

The [day-by-day schedule](Fall2018_day-by-day_schedule.pdf) from Fall 2018 has even more details on what we covered
