# APPM 5630 at CU Boulder: typed up notes


These are latex notes from the Fall 2018 class typed up by Mitchell Krock.

For future semesters, these notes might be modified/added/corrected (you can make a pull request if you have a change, or if you want to be very active, we can add you on the repo)

Note: the compiled pdf might not always be up-to-date
